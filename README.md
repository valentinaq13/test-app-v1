# test-app-v1

First, install the `expo-cli` globally:

```bash
npm install --global expo-cli
```

To verify the successful installation of CLI, run the following command:

```bash
expo whoami
```

If the installation is successful, you will see a "Not logged in" message since you are not logged in to an Expo account yet. You do not need an account to start and can proceed further with your project. However, if you want to register a new expo account, run the command:

```bash
expo register
```

If you already have an Expo account, you can log in to it by running the command:

```bash
expo login
```

Once you are logged in with your Expo account, install the project dependencies with the following command inside the project root:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the project locally with:

```bash
expo start
```
